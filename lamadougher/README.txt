Version: 1.1

Usage: See Script and forums!

Change Log:
	
	0.1: Initial commit, non-working
	0.2: Working, pretty rough though
	0.2.1: Temporarily took out antiban, outOfFlour pretty much just a placeholder now
	0.3: Working great! Implemented GUI configuration, fixed a bunch of stuff
	1.0: Fairly stable release, proggy implemented, antiban implemented
	1.1: So many failsafes implemented, probably will need more. Re-balanced antiban (buffed since it's only called at one point). Removed need for placing in slot 10 (didn't work anyway).

To Do:

	Fix stillHaveFlour() Function (scripts ends if bank is out of flour) <-- Priority
	Make proper proggy image (get the fade to black @ bottom be fade to transparent)
	Pretty up box drawing (truncate extraneous TPointArrays from ATPA)
